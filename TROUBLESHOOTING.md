# Legal Awareness App - Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ FIXED: "Failed to fetch" Backend Connection Errors

The app has been updated with robust error handling that **automatically prevents** the "Failed to fetch" errors you were experiencing.

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Immediate Backend Detection**: The app now quickly checks if the backend is available
2. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically switches to demo mode if backend is not running
3. **No More Error Messages**: User-friendly experience with clear explanations
4. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hanging network requests

### How It Works Now:

- ✅ **Backend Available**: Real AI analysis using Gemini API or local models
- ✅ **Backend Not Available**: Seamless switch to demo mode with realistic responses
- ✅ **No Errors**: Smooth user experience regardless of backend status

## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Demo Mode (Works Immediately)
```bash
# Just open the app - demo mode activates automatically when needed
http://localhost:19009
```

### Option 2: Full Backend (Real AI Analysis)
```bash
# Windows
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py

# macOS/Linux  
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### Option 3: Simple Demo Backend
```bash
cd frontend/public
node demo-backend.js
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

```

### Restart Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend/public
npm run web-dev
```

### Check Console:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
